# Generating Commit Messages

## Instructions

1. Run `git add .` to stage all changes (if not already staged)
2. Run `git diff --staged` to see changes
3. I'll suggest a single-sentence commit message under 50 characters
4. Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, style:, refactor:, test:, chore:)
5. Ensure clarity and context for future reference

## Best practices

- Use present tense
- Explain what and why, not how
