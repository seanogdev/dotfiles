You should follow the karpathy-guidelines in SKILL.md for all coding tasks.

## Browser Automation

Use `agent-browser` for web automation. Run `agent-browser --help` for all commands.

## Pull requests

Always try to use any pull request templates provided by the repository.

When writing pull request descriptions, aim for clarity and conciseness. Use bullet points or numbered lists to break down complex changes.

## Github

- Always use the `gh` cli for github operations.

## Plan Mode

- Make the plan extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any.
