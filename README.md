# Dotfiles

My macOS configuration files and utilities. Current shell of choice is `fish`.

**Current Machine**: 2016 MBP with Touch Bar 15", - 2.9Ghz i7 - 16GB RAM - AMD 460M

## macOS config

I use the invaluable [.macos](https://mths.be/macos) config file by [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles). (along with some of his useful aliases)

As he mentions in his [dotfiles README](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)

> **Warning**: If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/miralize/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
sh scripts/bootstrap.sh
```
